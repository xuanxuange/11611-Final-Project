1) Replace the "<has been> <____> <to be>" turn of phrase, flag this sentence and location accordingly (for future question gen. Store the turn of phrase somewhere)

    "has been" <some verb> to be" has been noticed as an english turn of phrase the parser dislikes.
    Examples include "Has been said to be", "has been proposed to be", "has been identified as", etc.

    replace the phrase with "is", or "was", or "will be" as appropriate (tense-dependent)


2) Fix/Separate SINV phraseology

    SINV refers to inverted declarative sentences
    examples found online include:

        i.      Do you understand Finnish? [interrogative]

        ii.     <Were she available>, we would surely invite her. [conditional]

        iii.    Not only <is the standard American aluminum can light in weight and rugged> but <it is also about the same height and diameter as the traditional drinking tumbler>.

    Only two cases that apply are ii and iii.

        Case ii:
        <SINV> , <S>        ==> [<S> <SINV>, <S> if <SINV-MOD>]

        Case iii:
        Not only <SINV> <, optional> but <S>    ==> [<S-MOD>, <SINV-MOD>]

    <S-MOD> = <S>, but remove any "also" that appears right after the main VB (directly under the main VP, and directly after a sequence of VB_)


3) Remove NP-prefixed SBAR from the sentence

    Somwhere in the sentence, you have <NP> <SBAR> as children of the same node.
    <SBAR> acts as a modifier upon the <NP> in this case, and is thus not essential to the meaning of the sentence.

    Additionally, because it is a modifier, we are able to create a constructor for questions asked in the following form:

           <S>
            |
    |---------------|
    |               |
    <NP1>     |------<VP>------|
              |       |        |
            <VB_>   <NP2>    <SBAR>

    Here, <SBAR> describes <NP2>, and can thus act as a stand in, in the question: "What did <NP1> <VB_> <SBAR> ?"
    After generating this question, remove SBAR from the sentence, return it to the pool


4) Separate root-level <S> <,> <CC> <S> into two separate sentences (assuming <S>'s are valid)

    <,> may or may not appear. Separate regardless

    Valid <S> have <NP> and <VP> as children, in that order, possibly with stuff prefixing or suffixing it
    <NP> and <VP> must both be valid for <S> to be valid
    <NP> is valid when it contains a <NN_> word
    <VP> is valid when it contains a <VB_> word


5) Rearrange <SBAR/PP>, <S> phrases into <S> <SBAR/PP> (Assuming <S> is a valid <NP> <VP> combination, as defined above)

    sentence will be of the form <SBAR/PP> <,> <S> (<,> is optional)
    Irrespective of presence of <,>, return the two sentences: [<S> <SBAR/PP>, <S>]


6) Rearrange <NP> <VP> phrases' NP components based on complexity (Assuming validity)

    If you have a <NP> <VP> adjacency of the following form:
           <?>
            |
     ---------------------
     |                   |
   <NP1>          ------<VP>-------
                  |               |
                <VB_>           <NP2>

    and <NP1> and <NP2> are both valid noun phrases, and <VB_> is a conjugation of "to be", then that establishes equivalence between <NP1> and <NP2>, which means they can be swapped around at will.

    Add the sentence that swaps <NP1> and <NP2> to the pool (keeping flags attached to the correct word)
    (should have both variants present. Probably should add a flag to the sentence so you don't end up with multiple copies of the same sentence getting added each passthrough)


7) Run appositive removal/manipulation (include all valid combinations)



8) Run parenthetical removal, flag the sentence and location accordingly (for future question gen. Keep the removed parenthetical stored somewhere)



9) Include every valid <NP> <VP> combo located within the sentence. Copy flag values to new sentence where applicable

    If, on any level, you have a valid <NP>, and a valid <VP> directly adjacent to each other, that forms a sentence.
    Add <NP> <VP> to the sentence pool
